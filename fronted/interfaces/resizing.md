# Resizing

You can resize the interface two ways: **dragging** and **specifying a size**

### Dragging

You can use the side handlers to resize the interface.

Be aware that this size is not the final size on the released application but a tool to help users see how their design will appear in different devices. The actual size depends on the device screen.

### Specifying a size \(BETA\)

For better control over how your application will be displayed on different devices you can specify a size or device by clicking on the size display
