# Projects

Abstra projects are fully-fledged applications.

You can build a SPA [front-end](front-end/), have it reading and writing to a [database]() and [calling external APIs]() and with one click have a production ready and shareable link of your released project.

Abstra projects are composed of three main sections

{% page-ref page="front-end/" %}

{% page-ref page="back-end.md" %}

{% page-ref page="settings/" %}
