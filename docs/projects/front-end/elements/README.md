# Components

Components are the semantic blocks of your application. Each component is housed inside a [slot](../slots/) and has several arguments that control its behavior and appearance.

Currently these are the supported components:

* [Text](text.md)
* [Button](button.md)
* [Image](image.md)
* [Input](input.md)
* [Dropdown](choose.md)
* [Video](video.md)
* [Table](table.md)
* [HTML](html.md)
* [Form](form.md)
* [List](collection.md)
* [Subview](subview.md)
* [Iframe](iframe.md)
