# Resizing

You can resize the interface two ways: **dragging** and **specifying a size**

{% hint style="warning" %}
Be aware that this size is not the final size on the released application but a tool to help users see how their design will appear in different devices. The actual size depends on the device screen.
{% endhint %}

## Dragging

You can use the side handlers to resize the interface.
