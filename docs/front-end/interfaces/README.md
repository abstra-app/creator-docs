# Pages

Pages are where you will organize your entire app and where your users will navigate through your application.

You can create as many pages as your app seems fit, name them as you want but remember to keep the `/` on the beginning.

Example: `/helloworld`

You can also change the background of your page by clicking anywhere on the screen and changing it on the editor.
