# Show modal

The `Show modal` action is used to display a modal to the users of your application.

You can choose a `Template`  to render inside your modal. A template can be an existing page or component of your application.

The example below shows the `WelcomeModal` component inside your modal and after being closed it redirects the user to the `/dashboard` page.

## Customization with springs

Every modal is just another component rendered on top of your original page. Therefore, you can always customize how things will appear by using springs. This can be used to create collapsable sidebars and toast alerts.
