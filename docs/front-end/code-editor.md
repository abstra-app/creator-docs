# Code Editor

Sometimes in Abstra you will utilize our code editor in order to do some advanced configurations (such as [execute js](actions/execute-javascript-code.md) and [expressions](arguments/expression-mode.md)) and, as usual, we got you covered with some hotkeys and quality of life features to help you writing down your code.



#### Code fold

With code fold you can hide some code snippets that you're not utilizing right now. It works with code wrapped on  `functions`,`if/else conditions` and `array declarations.`

#### Auto-Complete

Our code editor have some auto-completions to help you focus on what is important rather than have to remind simple syntax.
