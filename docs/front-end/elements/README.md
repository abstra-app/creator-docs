# Elements

Elements are the semantic blocks of your application. Each element is housed inside a [slot](../slots/) and has several [arguments](../arguments/) that control its behavior and appearance.

Currently these are the supported components:

* [Rectangle](rectangle.md)
* [Text](text.md)
* [Button](button.md)
* [Image]()
* [Input]()
* [Drop down]()
* [Video]()
* [Table]()
* [HTML]()
* [Form]()
* [List]()
* [Subview]()
* [Iframe](iframe.md)
