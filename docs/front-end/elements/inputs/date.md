# Date

Date inputs are basic date selection inputs for your application. They are commonly used when building forms.

When users click at this input it opens a date picker.

There are two special arguments: `Type of date` and `Date format`

* Date format: a string representing how would you like the selected date to be shown. The default is `YYYY-MM-DD`which means 4 digit year, 2 digit month and day separated by `-` \(ex: `1970-03-05`\). You can change this if you like to separate with / or format in different ways. The full syntax can be found [here](https://github.com/mengxiong10/vue2-datepicker#token). 
* Type of date: you can choose between `Complete Date` \(in which the user selects day, month and year\), `Year and Month` \(in which the user selects only year and month\) and `Only year` \(in which the user selects only the year\)

The other arguments are very similar to `Text Inputs` . You can checkout how their arguments work reading the [Text Input documentation](../text.md).
