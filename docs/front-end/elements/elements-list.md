When an element is hidden, it disappears from the view frame so it doesn't get in the way of creation, but you can find it through the list by hovering over the element's name.

To delete an element, you can click on the remove icon on the right side or select all the elements you want to delete with the shift key and press the delete key on your keyboard.
