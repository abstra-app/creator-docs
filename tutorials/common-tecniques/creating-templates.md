# Creating Templates

After finishing a project that you feel it could be used as a baseline for your future projects you can create a template based on it.

Go to the settings tab and inside of it, on the general tab, there will be a button "Publish as Template".

Press it to make a modal appear where you will set the template's name and description. Have in mind that every template must have a name and description.

After deciding your template name and description just press on publish and you're all set. Your template will be ready to be used when you create new projects. :)

Go to your workspace, click on "or choose a template", and select it within your list of templates.

You can also choose to start a new project from some templates we did for you. All in order to give you more speed on developing your new app.
