# Projects

Abstra projects are fully-fledged applications.

You can build a SPA [front-end](front-end/), have it reading and writing to a [database](back-end/tables.md) and [calling external APIs](back-end/connectors.md) and with one click have a production ready and shareable link of your released project.
