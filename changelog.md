* We are happy to announce that the [Google Sheets Connector](docs/back-end/connectors/google-sheets.md) is now on Beta;
* Now when you press alt while dragging a component and release the mouse button it will duplicate your component. \(Before it would only do so if you were pressing alt at the start of the click\);
* Fixed the bug related to style arguments showing a default value when disabled;
* Fixed the bug related to the color input changing the color to black randomly.
* Added an option to set the first row as a header in the Get Range method of [Google Sheets Connector](docs/back-end/connectors/google-sheets.md)
* Added a Storage Connector to allow you to upload, list and download files from a storage provider.
